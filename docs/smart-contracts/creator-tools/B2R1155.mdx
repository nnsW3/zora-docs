title: Burn to Redeem
---
---

Burn to redeem allows for a combination of token types to be burned to claim an 1155 token.
For example, a requirement could be to burn `x` amount of a specific 721 and `y` amount of a specific 1155 token to be able to mint an 1155 token.

Supported Burn Token Types:
- ERC-20 
- ERC-721
- ERC-1155

Features: 
- Multi Token Types in a Single Redemption
- ETH Payment Option
- Supports Specific TokenId Ranges
- ETH Payments

## Factory Contract
For security reasons, each Zora 1155 contract needs to have a unique burn to redeem minter deployed for it.
Meaning, that the factory contract must be called to create a unique burn to redeem minter for each 1155 creator contract. 


### Checking if a Minter has been deployed
Before deploying a minter for an 1155, it is possible to check and see if one has been deployed or not by calling the contract. 

`getDeployedRedeemMinterForCreatorContract` returns an `address` based on whether a B2R minter contract has been deployed for a specific 1155 contract.
The function will return an error if no contract has been deployed.
```
function getDeployedRedeemMinterForCreatorContract(
    address _creatorContract 
) external view returns (address) 
```

`doesRedeemMinterExistForCreatorContract` returns a bool based on whether a contract has been deployed when given the creator's 1155 contract address. 

```
function doesRedeemMinterExistForCreatorContract(
    address _creatorContract
) public view returns (bool) 
```

`predictMinterAddress` returns the address that the b2r minter will be deployed to when given the creator's 1155 contract address. 

```
function predictMinterAddress(
    address _creatorContract
) public view returns (address)
```

### Deploying the Minter
Deploying a minter is done by calling the `callSale` function on the 1155 contract.

The factory uses `CREATE2` to generate the B2R contract addresses. 
This means the address of the deployment can be known ahead of time by calling `predictMinterAddress` with the 1155 address.

The following can be done in a single transaction using multi-call.
The data structure for `REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS` can be found [here](./B2R1155#data-structures).

Multi-call if the B2R contract hasn't been deployed, but 1155 contract has:

1. `setPermissions(REDEMPTION_MINTER_FACTORY, MINTER)`: Give permission to the factory.
2. `callSale(REDEMPTION_MINTER_FACTORY, abi.encode(createMinter))`: Use the callSale function on the 1155 contract.
    - `target.callSale(0, minterFactory, abi.encodeWithSelector(ZoraCreatorRedeemMinterFactoryImpl.createMinter.selector));`
3. `clearPermissions(REDEMPTION_MINTER_FACTORY, NONE)`: Remove permission.
4. `setPermissions(REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, MINTER)`: Give permission to the minter.
5. `callSale(REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, abi.encode(setRedeem, {REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS})`: Use callSale on the 1155 to set up a redemption.

<br/> 

Multi-call if the B2R contract has been deployed and already has minter permissions:
1. `callSale(REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, abi.encode(setRedeem, {REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS})`

## Redeem Minter

Each 1155 contract must have its own deployed burn to redeem minter contract. 

### Redeeming a Token
Before a token can be redeemed all the tokens that will be burned must be approved to the specific burn to redeem contract.
Once approved, then the user can call the `mint` function on the 1155 contract to burn their tokens in exchange for the redeemed token. 
The data structure for the instructions and args can be found below.
```
mint(
    REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, 
    tokenId, // Mint Token
    quantity, // Mint Amount
    abi.encode(
        MINT_TO_ADDRESS, 
        REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS, 
        REDEEM_ARGS
    ))
```

### Updating a Redemption
There is no update function within the burn to redeem minter. 
This means updating requires that a user clear their previous redeem and set a new one.
Note, that the `clearRedeem` function takes in a hash of the instructions. 
```
callSale(
    REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, 
    abi.encode(clearRedeem({REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS_HASH}))
)
```

```
callSale(
    REDEMPTION_MINTER_CONTRACT, 
    abi.encode(setRedeem({REDEEM_INSTRUCTIONS}))
)
```

## Data Structures

### Redeem Instructions
Instructions are set when the creator decides on the burn-to-redeem options.

```
enum RedeemTokenType {
  NULL,
  ERC721,
  ERC1155,
  ERC20,
}

enum ZoraCreatePermissions {
  NONE = 0,
  ADMIN = 2 ** 1,
  MINTER = 2 ** 2,
}

type RedeemInstruction = {
  tokenType: RedeemTokenType
  amount: BigNumber
  tokenIdStart: BigNumber
  tokenIdEnd: BigNumber
  tokenContract: `0x${string}`
  transferRecipient: `0x${string}`
  burnFunction: `0x${string}`
}

type RedeemMinterConfig = {
  mintToken: {
    tokenContract: `0x${string}`
    tokenId: BigNumber
    amount: BigNumber
    tokenType: RedeemTokenType
  }
  instructions: RedeemInstruction[]
  saleStart: BigNumber
  saleEnd: BigNumber
  ethAmount: BigNumber
  ethRecipient: `0x${string}`
}

```
